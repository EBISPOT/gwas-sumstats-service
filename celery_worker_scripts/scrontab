# Welcome to scrontab, Slurm's cron-like interface.
#
# Edit this file to submit recurring jobs to be run by Slurm.
#
# Note that jobs will be run based on the Slurm controller's
# time and timezone.
#
# Lines must either be valid entries, comments (start with '#'),
# or blank.
#
# Lines starting with #SCRON will be parsed for options to use
# with the next cron line. E.g., "#SCRON --time 1" would request
# a one minute timelimit be applied. See the sbatch man page for
# options, although note that not all options are supported here.
#
# For example, the following line (when uncommented) would request
# a job be run at 5am each day.
# 0 5 * * * /my/script/to/run
#
# min hour day-of-month month day-of-week command

#SCRON -t 1
#SCRON --mem=1
